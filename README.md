# chukmon: Companies House Monitor

# About
This is a python flask application which will retrieve company information from Companies House and display it in a dashboard. You can exclude companies from the main view as well as use the responsive search and/or export functions of the tables. 

This might be useful for OSINT or monitoring for `look-a-like` companies being setup.
